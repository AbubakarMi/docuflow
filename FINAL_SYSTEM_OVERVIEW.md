## 📦 The Inventory Magic

### How It Works:

**Scenario:** Selling drinks from inventory

**Step 1: Upload Stock**
```
Go to: /stock
Product: Coca Cola 500ml
Click: "Add Stock"
Enter: 50 units
Result: Stock = 50
```

**Step 2: Create Invoice**
```
Go to: /invoices/create
Customer: John Doe
Add Item:
  - Product: Coca Cola 500ml
  - Quantity: 2
  - Price: $1.50

System Validates: Is 2 ≤ 50? ✅ Yes
```

**Step 3: Automatic Deduction**
```
Invoice Created: INV-1001
System Actions:
  1. ✅ Deduct 2 from stock (50 → 48)
  2. ✅ Record movement:
     - Type: OUT
     - Quantity: 2
     - Invoice: INV-1001
     - Reason: "Stock sold via invoice INV-1001"
  3. ✅ Update product stockQuantity
```

**Result:**
- ✅ Invoice created successfully
- ✅ Stock automatically: 48 units
- ✅ Movement recorded
- ✅ No manual tracking needed!
