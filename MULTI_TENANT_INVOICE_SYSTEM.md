# Multi-Tenant Invoice Management System

A comprehensive, production-ready invoice generation and management system built with Next.js 15, PostgreSQL, and Prisma. Features complete multi-tenancy, allowing multiple businesses to operate independently within a single database.

## 🎯 Overview

This system provides a complete solution for businesses to:
- Register and manage their business profile
- Create and manage customers
- Maintain product/service catalogs
- Generate professional invoices with line items
- Track payments and outstanding balances
- Generate PDF invoices
- Multi-tenant architecture with complete data isolation

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Multi-Tenant Design

The system uses a **single database, multiple tenant** architecture:

- **One Database**: `docuflow`
- **Business Isolation**: Every table includes `businessId` to segregate data
- **Automatic Tenant Creation**: When a business registers, all necessary tables and settings are automatically created
- **Complete Data Isolation**: All queries are scoped by `businessId` to ensure tenants cannot access each other's data

### Database Schema
