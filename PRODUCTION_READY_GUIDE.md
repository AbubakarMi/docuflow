## 📋 WHAT'S BEEN IMPLEMENTED

### 1. ✅ Comprehensive Business Registration
**File**: [src/app/(auth)/register/page.tsx](src/app/(auth)/register/page.tsx)

**4-Step Registration Process:**

- **Step 2**: Business Address (street, city, state, ZIP, country)
- **Step 3**: Tax & Legal (Tax ID, registration number, currency, timezone, fiscal year)
- **Step 4**: Admin Account (name, email, password)

**Features**:
- ✅ Beautiful multi-step form with progress indicator
- ✅ Full validation and error handling
- ✅ Auto-generates invoice prefix from business name
