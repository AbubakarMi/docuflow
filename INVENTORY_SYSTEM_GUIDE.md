# üì¶ Inventory Management System - Complete Guide

## üéØ Overview

DocuFlow now includes a **complete inventory management system** that automatically tracks stock levels and deducts inventory when invoices are created.

---

## ‚úÖ System Features

### 1. **Automatic Stock Deduction**
When you create an invoice with products, the system automatically:
- ‚úÖ Validates stock availability
- ‚úÖ Deducts sold quantity from inventory
- ‚úÖ Records the transaction
- ‚úÖ Updates stock levels in real-time

### 2. **Stock Movement Tracking**
Every inventory change is tracked:
- **IN**: When you add/upload stock
- **OUT**: When products are sold (invoice created)
- **ADJUSTMENT**: Manual stock corrections

### 3. **Low Stock Alerts**
- Set alert thresholds per product
- Visual indicators for low stock items
- Out-of-stock warnings

---

## üöÄ How It Works

### Example Scenario:

**Before Invoice:**
- Product: Coca Cola 500ml
- Stock: 50 units

**Create Invoice:**
- Customer buys 2 units
- System checks: Is 2 ‚â§ 50? ‚úÖ Yes
- Invoice created successfully

**After Invoice:**
- Stock automatically becomes: 48 units
- Stock movement recorded
- History updated

---

## üìä Database Structure

### Tables

#### 1. **products**
```sql
- stockQuantity: Current available stock
- trackInventory: Enable/disable tracking
- lowStockAlert: Threshold for alerts
```

#### 2. **stock_movements** (NEW)
```sql
- type: 'in', 'out', 'adjustment'
- quantity: Units moved
- previousQty: Stock before
- newQty: Stock after
- invoiceId: Reference to invoice (if sold)
- reason: Why the movement occurred
- createdBy: Who made the change
```
