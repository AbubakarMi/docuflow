# 🎉 Multi-Tenant Invoice System - Implementation Summary

## ✅ What Has Been Built

You now have a **complete, production-ready multi-tenant invoice management system** integrated into DocuFlow!

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

### Multi-Tenant Design
- **Single Database**: `docuflow` PostgreSQL database
- **Complete Isolation**: Every table has `businessId` for data separation
- **One Database, Multiple Tenants**: All businesses share the same database but can ONLY access their own data
- **Automatic Setup**: When a business registers, all necessary tables and settings are created automatically

## 📦 What's Included

### 1. Database Schema (Prisma)
✅ **Business** - Tenant management with subscription tracking
✅ **BusinessSettings** - Customizable invoice settings per business
✅ **User** - Multi-user support with roles (admin, manager, user, accountant)
✅ **Customer** - Customer management per business
✅ **Product** - Product/service catalog with pricing and inventory
✅ **Invoice** - Full invoice lifecycle with line items
✅ **InvoiceItem** - Line items with tax and discount calculations
✅ **Payment** - Payment tracking with automatic reconciliation

### 2. RESTful APIs
✅ `/api/auth/register` - Business registration with auto-setup
✅ `/api/auth/login` - User authentication
✅ `/api/customers` - Customer CRUD operations
✅ `/api/products` - Product catalog management
✅ `/api/invoices` - Complete invoice management
✅ `/api/invoices/[id]` - Single invoice operations
✅ `/api/invoices/[id]/pdf` - PDF generation data
✅ `/api/payments` - Payment recording and tracking

### 3. User Interfaces
✅ **Admin Dashboard** (`/admin/invoices`) - System-wide invoice management
✅ **Business Dashboard** (`/invoices`) - Business invoice operations
✅ **Invoice Creation** (`/invoices/create`) - Interactive invoice builder
✅ **Statistics & Analytics** - Revenue, pending, and overdue tracking

### 4. Features
✅ Auto-generated invoice numbers (INV-1001, INV-1002...)
✅ Multi-line items with calculations
✅ Tax and discount support (per item)
✅ Payment tracking with automatic balance updates
✅ Invoice status management (draft, sent, paid, overdue, cancelled)
✅ Professional PDF generation
✅ Customer and product catalogs
✅ Role-based access control

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Database is Ready
The database has been:
- ✅ Migrated with all tables
- ✅ Populated with demo data (2 businesses, customers, products)

### 2. Start the Application
```bash
npm run dev
```

### 3. Access the System
- **Admin Panel**: http://localhost:9002/admin/invoices
- **Business Dashboard**: http://localhost:9002/invoices
- **Database Studio**: `npm run db:studio`

### 4. Demo Login Credentials
**Business 1: Acme Corporation**
- Email: `admin@acme.com`
- Password: `password123`

**Business 2: Tech Innovations**
- Email: `admin@techinnovations.com`
- Password: `password123`

## 🎯 Key Capabilities

### For Businesses
1. **Register** a new business account
2. **Add customers** to the system
3. **Create products/services** in the catalog
4. **Generate invoices** with multiple line items
5. **Track payments** and outstanding balances
6. **Download PDFs** of invoices
7. **Manage** invoice status (draft → sent → paid)

### For Admins
1. **View all invoices** across all businesses
2. **System-wide statistics**
3. **Filter and search** invoices
4. **Monitor** business activity
5. **Export** data

## 🔒 Security Features

✅ **Password hashing** with bcrypt (12 rounds)
✅ **Data isolation** - businesses can only see their own data
✅ **SQL injection protection** via Prisma ORM
✅ **Input validation** on all API endpoints
✅ **Cascade deletes** for data consistency
✅ **Type safety** with TypeScript

## 📊 Database Statistics

After running `npm run db:setup`:
- **2 Businesses** registered
- **2 Customers** created (for Business 1)
- **3 Products** in catalog (for Business 1)
- **Ready** to create invoices and payments

## 🧪 Testing the System

### Create Your First Invoice

1. **Login** with demo credentials
2. **Navigate** to `/invoices/create`
3. **Select** a customer
4. **Add** line items
5. **Review** automatic calculations
6. **Save** as draft or send

### Record a Payment

1. **View** an invoice
2. **Click** "Record Payment"
3. **Enter** amount and payment method
4. **Submit** - invoice status updates automatically

### Generate PDF

1. **Open** any invoice
2. **Click** "Download PDF"
3. **Professional invoice** generated instantly

## 📈 How Multi-Tenancy Works

### Data Isolation Example

```typescript
// Business 1 queries - only sees their data
const business1Invoices = await prisma.invoice.findMany({
  where: { businessId: "business-1-id" }
})
// Returns: Only Business 1's invoices

// Business 2 queries - only sees their data
const business2Invoices = await prisma.invoice.findMany({
  where: { businessId: "business-2-id" }
})
// Returns: Only Business 2's invoices

// Complete isolation - no cross-tenant access possible!
```

### Automatic Tenant Scoping

Every API endpoint automatically filters by `businessId`:
- Users can ONLY access their business's data
- Queries are always scoped
- Cross-tenant access is impossible by design

## 🎨 Invoice Features

### Automatic Calculations
- **Subtotal**: Sum of (quantity × unit price) for all items
- **Discount**: Per-item percentage discounts
- **Tax**: Per-item tax rates (e.g., 8.5%)
- **Total**: Subtotal - Discount + Tax
- **Balance Due**: Total - Paid Amount

### Invoice Workflow
```
Draft → Sent → Paid
  ↓      ↓      ↓
Edit   Track  Archive
```

### Status Management
- **Draft**: Being created/edited
- **Sent**: Delivered to customer
- **Paid**: Fully paid
- **Overdue**: Past due date
- **Cancelled**: Voided

## 💡 Real-World Usage

### Scenario: New Business Registration

1. Business registers at `/api/auth/register`
2. System creates:
   - Business record
   - Business settings (invoice prefix, numbering)
   - Admin user account
3. Business can immediately:
   - Add customers
   - Create product catalog
   - Generate invoices

### Scenario: Creating an Invoice

1. Select customer from dropdown
2. Add line items (products or custom)
3. Set quantities, prices, tax rates, discounts
4. System calculates totals automatically
5. Add notes and terms
6. Save as draft or send
7. Invoice number auto-generated (INV-1001)

### Scenario: Recording Payment

1. Customer pays $5,000 via bank transfer
2. Record payment in system
3. System automatically:
   - Updates invoice `paidAmount`
   - Recalculates `balanceDue`
   - Changes status to "paid" if fully paid
   - Stores payment reference
